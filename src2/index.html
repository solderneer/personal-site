          <!-- description and about me goes here -->
          <p>
            I'm passionate about creating a better world through technology,
            and bringing the benefits of robotics to people, communities and businesses.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm just about to graduate from NUS High School in Singapore, and I've
            learnt many things while schooling there. I spent my time tinkering and working
            on side projects involving electronics, app design, computer science and robotics along
            with some awesome friends.
          </p>
          <p>
            My dream is to start successful tech startups that bring innovative ideas involving robotics
            and AI to the table. I want to see a world where humanity and robots are able to co-exist and
            co-operate for the betterment of society.
